# All Is Grow: Agricultural Empowerment Through Remote Sensing Technology ðŸŒ¾

## Overview

The **All Is Grow** project aims to revolutionize the agricultural sector in the Philippines by addressing key challenges such as low farm productivity, inadequate infrastructure, and climate-related vulnerabilities. By leveraging **remote sensing technology** powered by Google Earth Engine, this system provides actionable insights to various agricultural stakeholders, including farmers, agribusiness managers, urban agriculturists, and disaster response officers.

## Key Features

1. **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Forecasting**

   - Predicts vegetation health and productivity.
   - Assists in irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.
   - Aids disaster recovery with vegetation recovery analysis.

2. **Crop Mapping and Yield Prediction**

   - Provides precise resource allocation insights.
   - Reduces losses through optimized crop management.

3. **Drought Monitoring and Flood Mapping**

   - Delivers early warnings for droughts and floods.
   - Enhances disaster management and risk mitigation.

4. **Soil Health Assessment**

   - Maps soil properties for sustainable land use.
   - Supports climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration monitoring.

5. **Climate Adaptation Strategies**
   - Guides farmers in selecting climate-resilient crops.
   - Analyzes soil moisture and weather trends for effective land management.
